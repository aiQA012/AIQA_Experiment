# 1. Welcome to Join Our AIQA Experiment!

Qualitative analysis (QA) is widely used in human computer interaction and social computing research areas. Coding is one of the important processes in QA to form and find patterns and insights in the qualitative data. It heavily depends on human labor, which is very low-efficient and time-consuming. In the past few years, researchers have proposed to use AI (Artificial Intelligence) to improve the efficiency of this process. However, the collaboration part in coding process hasnâ€™t been a focus by them. Our project aims at improving the efficiency of coding process by providing AI based collaboration tool. By using AI to assist the collaboration process between different coders in coding process, the efficiency of coding process could be improved. This may save much time for QA researchers.

# 2. A Five-minute Introduction to Qualitative Analysis

Please watch the following video to get an understanding of how to do qualitative analysis (sometimes it is also called qualitative coding, but they are not exactly the same).

# 3. Experiment Process

## 1) Task Introduction

You are a pair of researchers who are trying to perform qualitative analysis on interview transcripts of students undergoing a preparatory mock interview. The research question is to find general qualities of candidates (include good and bad ones). 

Your task is to code the sentences so that we may obtain a meaningful analysis of the transcripts. Here's an example. If we were to analyse meeting transcripts, a likely thing to be said during a meeting might be:

> "Ok, can Alice please follow up with Bob on the designs".

- A reasonable way to **code** this sentence could be Action Items.
- A succinct **subcode** or **description** could be "A person was asked to follow up on a task".
- This sentence would then be added as one of the **examples** of such an Action Items code.

## 2) Try the App!

Here you can try traditional [etherpad](https://rich.etherpad.com/). For the control experiment group, we will use this app to do qualitative analysis. In our experiment group, we will use an AI assisted tool to provide suggestions for your coding process! You will be assigned to experiment group or control group randomly.

## 3) Study Instruction

**Creating the Codebook**

1. Mark up the first two interview records individually. (~20 mins).
2. Discuss the points you have found, and create one codebook (combining all the codes/subcodes from two materials) like the following (~30-40 mins):

**Coding using the Codebook**

3. Mark up the remaining one document (~10-20 minutes).
4. Fill up the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1E5ng5UotxJM_UkwdRDILn7qNA8xvFCCUnl_8dpaiVPk/edit) (~5 minutes).
5. Answer the following questions (~5 minutes):
   - Do you think the final result achieved the original purpose (summarize the good qualities of interviewees)?
   - During the labeling process, what are the difficulties when you label individually? What is the most difficult part in the collaboration between each other?
