# 1. Welcome to Join Our AIQA Study!

Qualitative analysis (QA), a common method in human-computer interaction and social computing research, involves a key process known as coding. This procedure is crucial for discerning patterns and extracting insights from qualitative data, though it's traditionally labor-intensive and time-consuming. In recent years, researchers have introduced Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the efficiency of this process. However, they've largely overlooked the collaborative aspect of the coding process. Our project seeks to bridge this gap by offering an AI-based tool to streamline collaboration among coders. Utilizing AI to facilitate this interaction could potentially improve coding efficiency, potentially saving considerable time for QA researchers.

# 2. Study Process

## 1) Task Introduction

You are a pair of researchers who are trying to perform qualitative analysis on interview transcripts of students undergoing a preparatory mock interview. The research question is to find general qualities of candidates (include good and bad ones). 

Your task is to code the sentences so that we may obtain a meaningful analysis of the transcripts. Here's an example. If we were to analyse meeting transcripts, a likely thing to be said during a meeting might be:

> "Ok, can Alice please follow up with Bob on the designs".

- A reasonable way to **code** this sentence could be *Action Items*.
- A succinct **subcode** or **description** could be "A person was asked to follow up on a task".
- This sentence would then be added as one of the **examples** of *Action Items* code.

## 2) Study Instruction

<!-- ### ExB:
**Creating the Codebook**

1. Mark up the first two interview transcripts individually. (~10-20 mins).
2. Discuss the codes you have found, and create one codebook (combining all the codes/subcodes from two materials) like the following (~30 mins):

**Coding using the Codebook**

3. Mark up the remaining one material individually (~10 minutes).
4. Fill up the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1E5ng5UotxJM_UkwdRDILn7qNA8xvFCCUnl_8dpaiVPk/edit) (~3 minutes).
5. Answer the following questions (~5 minutes):
   - During the labeling process, what are the difficulties when you label individually? 
   - What are the difficulties when collaborating with each other?
   - How do you think AIcoder deal with these difficulties between each other?
   - How do you feel when there is a code in the code list that you didn't add?
   - How do you feel like the confidence level?
   - Did AI help you deal with the conflicts between each other?
   - Do you use the AIcoder frequently? Why?
   - Do you feel that AIcoder helps you improve your coding efficiency and collaboration efficiency?
   - Do you feel it becomes faster after codebook forming, how? -->

<!-- ### ExC:

**Creating the Codebook**

1. The first coder marks up the first two interview transcripts individually (with ai model training), another coder can take a rest. (~10-15 mins).
2. The second coder marks up the two interview transcripts individually (with the same ai model training), another coder can take a rest. (~10-15 mins).
3. Discuss the codes you have found, and create one codebook (combining all the codes/subcodes from two materials) like the following (~30-40 mins):
